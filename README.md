 Operating Platforms
 
    Client and Software Requirements:
        The client, The Gaming Room, sought to expand their Android game, Draw It or Lose It, into a web-based application supporting multiple platforms. The game involves teams guessing phrases based on rendered stock drawings, emphasizing a fun and interactive experience.

    Strengths in Documentation Development:
        The documentation clearly explained the client's requirements, providing a comprehensive overview of the software design process. The systematic breakdown of evaluation criteria, domain modeling, and recommendations demonstrated a thorough understanding of the project.

    Process of Working through the Design Document:
        Developing the documentation was helpful in establishing a structured roadmap for the software design. It provided a clear framework for decision-making, ensuring that key considerations, such as platform evaluations and development tool selections, were systematically addressed.

    Potential Revision:
        If revising, I would further emphasize the integration of user-centric design principles in the documentation. While user needs were considered, enhancing this aspect could strengthen the focus on delivering an intuitive and enjoyable gaming experience. This improvement could involve more detailed user scenarios and interface design considerations.

    User Needs Interpretation:
        Interpreting user needs involved close collaboration with the client, understanding their vision for the game, and considering potential user scenarios. This process ensured that the software design aligned with the client's objectives and created a user-friendly interface. Addressing user needs is vital as it directly impacts user satisfaction, engagement, and the overall success of the software.

    Approach to Software Design:
        The software design process involved a holistic approach, considering technical requirements, platform evaluations, and user experience. Techniques included creating a UML class diagram for domain modeling and systematically evaluating different operating systems and development tools. For future projects, I would continue employing these techniques while placing an even greater emphasis on iterative prototyping and user feedback to refine the design.
